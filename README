This program runs with 4 different processes. Three processes that generates
random numbers, when the number is prime the process send it to main process via named pipe.
And one process - the main process that collect the primes send from the other processes
via named pipe and insert them into array, when the main process gets 1000 primes,
alert to the 3 other process to end, prints the minimum prime, max prime and number of
different numbers in the array, close all named pipe and finish.
when the other processes get the massage from main process to end they prints the
prime number they send the most to main process, and finish.

Compile: gcc -Wall ex4a1.c -o ex4a1
         gcc -Wall ex4a2.c -o ex4a2
     (ex4a1 = main process, ex4a2 = sub process)

Run: for start run the main process with the 4 named pipe names.
    Then, run 3 times the sub processes and send to the vector
    arguments the main named pipe 'fifo0' and the number of process (1-3):
        ./ex4a1 fifo0 fifo1 fifo2 fifo3
        ./ex4a2 fifo0 1
        ./ex4a2 fifo0 2
        ./ex4a2 fifo0 3

Input: No Input

Output:
    From main process (ex4a1) = minimum prime, max prime and number of
    different numbers in the array.
    Example: The number of different primes received is: 168
             The max prime is: 997. The min primes is: 2
    From sub process (ex4a2) = prime number they send the most to main process
    Example: Process 1101373 sent the prime 233, 14 times
